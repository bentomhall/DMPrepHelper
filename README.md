# DMPrepHelper

Designed to help overworked DMs and world-builders generate content that matches their setting. There are 3 modules--

* Generate randomized NPC
* Generate randomized settlement
* Generate seeds for adventure sites

Configuration of the setting information is possible in-app with full documentation. Generated items can be exported to a structured plain-text format.

##Installation:
**This package will only work on the Fall Creator's Update for Windows 10 or more recent updates.**
Go to the "releases" tab and download the Appx package. Double click it and hit "install."

## NPC Generator
This module generates as many random NPC ideas as you want for a specific nation (user-definable). Each NPC has the following characteristics:

* A name that depends on the race and culture.
* An age, gender, and race (with possible subrace). Genders and race data are configurable, ages are descriptive (young, old, etc).
* A profession (randomly chosen from a configurable list of medieval occupations)
* An indicator of religious sentiment (devout, causual, athiest, animist, etc)
* A key personality trait.

## Settlement Generator
This module generates random villages, towns, or other settlements based on your selection of the nearest big city (from which it draws its demographics).
Each settlement has the following characteristics:

* A name
* A size (town, village, fort, etc), population, and a role (agriculture, mining, subsistence, etc)
* A location (near a particular city)
* Demographic information: how many of what races
* A user-configurable list of important NPCs (using the NPC generator)
* Tech levels for various categories of items and services
* A list of *unavailable* items (currently using the 5e PHB items, but that's user-configurable)

## Adventure Site Generator
This module generates adventure site ideas based on the regions of your setting. Each site has the following information:
* A type (with subtype)
* A suggested median level (based on tiers of play: 1-4, 5-10, 11-16, 17-20, 21-30)
* A size (small, medium, or large) based on the map scale
* A number of separately-mapped areas
* A main monster type
* The presence or absence of a boss monster
